### INSPIRATION (2 - 3 sentences)

We drew inspiration from [speedtest.net](http://speedtest.net) as we found that the way they displayed their information was clear and concise, and was easily understood by users who weren't as tech savvy. Another website we drew information from was [https://explorer.helium.com/](https://explorer.helium.com/) as they were also able to separate a large amount of data into many smaller pieces that are easier to digest. Keeping these both in mind, we were able to narrow down the kind of information we wanted users to easily see.

### WHAT YOU BUILT (2 - 3 sentences)

A means to display research visually with a basic report to back up findings. We wanted to report this from a social angle and make it easily accessible to those who might not know

### HOW YOU BUILT IT (2 - 3 sentences)

This was done by sorting through data using Excel, combining averages for multiple tests per month, and then categorizing it. This categorization was then added to Google Maps, along with data that was scraped for municipal leaders.

### HOW IT WORKS (2 - 3 sentences)

Simply navigate through the site, and use the map to find a municipality in Alberta. Users can then choose to see which municipalities meet the speed standard set by the CRTC (50 Mbps DL, 10 Mbps UL)

### IMPACT (2 -3 sentences)

We hope that anyone is able to use this and that it is written plainly enough to understand where there are lower speeds, and why.

### CHALLENGES YOU RAN INTO (2 - 3 sentences)

As most of us are extremely new to data science, one of the biggest challenges we came across was understanding how to filter mass amounts data, and where to start. As users of the internet, we were able to sort information important to us, and next came the problem of finding a way to show the information in a way that it is easy to understand.

### ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT YOU’RE PROUD OF (2 - 3 sentences)

We would have to say that we're proud of handing something in. Jokes aside, it was great to be able to pull through to the end with Satveer leading and delegating tasks. We hope that we've created something that scratches the surface on understanding the disparity.

### LESSONS YOU’VE LEARNED (2 - 3 sentences)

Groupwork can be challenging especially when it is virtual. You need a leader who will delegate tasks based on each other's knowledge, and that it's extremely difficult and stressful to manage when all group members have their own day to day duties, especially during the pandemic.
